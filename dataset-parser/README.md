# Dataset Parser

This is a java program used to categorize images from a dataset with corresponding JSON files into class directories.

It can be used from the command line:

To compile, ``` $ javac JsonDirectoryConfigurator.java ```
To run, ``` $ java JsonDirectoryConfigurator ```

Or you can import the project as an Eclipse project.

Note: ```String newDirPath``` is wherever you want the output stored on your computer, and
```String datasetPath``` is wherever you have the dataset stored.
