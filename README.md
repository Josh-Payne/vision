# Computer Vision for StanfordAIR's 2018 AUVSI Entry

## Guidelines

Make a separate folder for the system you are developing. For example, I placed my orientation recognition algorithm in orientation/. Within the folder, include a readme that'll point to the main script to call to use whatever component of our vision system you've implemented, and any other information you think other's on the team should have.

## Contributing

First, fork this repository into your own account, then clone the fork to your desktop using 
``` $ git clone "url" ```.
Once you've done this, you can add/edit files on your master or dev branches. Once you're ready, commit the changes, push, and open a pull request. If you have 'write' access, you'll be able to merge the changes to the vision:master branch, and if not, just ask someone who does for it. (Or just ask for us to pull the changes.) 

Happy hacking!
